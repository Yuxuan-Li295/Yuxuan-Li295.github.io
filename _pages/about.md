I am a new graduate who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a master degree in Computer Information Technology & System Engineering. During my tenure at Upenn, I gained solid foundation knowledge in computer programming, network & protocol, database and data structure & algorithms. I am also a TA at [Penn Engineering Online](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/) for course ESE5420: Statistisc for machine learning and CIS5500: Database & Info System. I am currently actively seeking for an entry-level job(open to new graduate opportunity). 

I have working experience at [YORG AI](https://www.yorg.ai/) where I work as a front-end engineer and specializing in web application developement. where I used React and Typescript to build the reusable component library. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained valuable experience in the computer software developemnt lifecycle, from initial development to testing and deployment. I am dedicated to creating user-friendly and efficient web solutions. My prior experience also included internship 

In 2022, I was selected as one of the [2022 AI 2000 Most Influential Scholars](https://www.aminer.cn/ai2000?domain_ids=5dc122672ebaa6faa962c2a4) by AMiner between 2012-2021 (ranked 49/2000). Four of my first-author papers are ranked by Google Scholar as [highly-cited papers](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/421192644). I gave tutorials at [IJCAI'22](https://dgresearch.github.io/), WSDM 2023, and KDD 2023.

**Research interest:** robust machine learning, out-of-distribution / domain generalization, transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, federated learning, and related applications such as activity recognition and computer vision. These days, I'm particularly interested in Large Language Models (LLMs) robustness. See this [page](https://jd92.wang/research/) for more details. *Interested in [internship](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/102558267) or collaboration? Contact me.*

**Announcement:** I'm experimenting a new form of research collaboration. You can click [here](https://forms.office.com/r/32Fs6uAjT6) if you are interested!
