I am a new graduate who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a master degree in Computer Information Technology & System Engineering. During my tenure at Upenn, I gained solid foundation knowledge in computer programming, network & protocol, database and data structure & algorithms. I am also a TA at [Penn Engineering Online](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/) for course ESE5420: Statistisc for machine learning and CIS5500: Database & Info System. I am currently actively seeking for an entry-level job(open to new graduate opportunity). 

I have working experience at [YORG AI](https://www.yorg.ai/) where I work as a front-end engineer and specializing in web application developement. where I used React and Typescript to build the reusable component library. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained valuable experience in the computer software developemnt lifecycle, from initial development to testing and deployment. I am dedicated to creating user-friendly and efficient web solutions. My prior experience also included software engineer internship at [RELAYTO] (https://relayto.com/) and [Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com/global/) where I gained valued software engineer experience with regard to generative AI, AWS(CDK, SDK, S3, EC2, DynamoDB, ECR, ECS) and led unit-testing, stress-testing and integration testing with upstream and downstream teams to ensure robust testing of business logic. 

**Career interest:** I have 3 years opt and would willing to relocate to any place. And I am now loacted in Los Angeles, CA. I have experience in both front-end and back-end development and open to any full-stack, front-end, back-end software engineer position. Thank you in advance for any connections, advice, or opportunities you can offer!
